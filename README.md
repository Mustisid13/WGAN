# WGAN
Hello all, recently I was studying about the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) and WGAN-GP(Gradient Penalty).

What is WGAN?
The Wasserstein GAN or WGAN is a GAN variant which uses the 1-Wasserstein distance, rather than the JS-Divergence, to measure the difference between the model and target distributions. This seemingly simple change has big consequences! Not only does WGAN train more easily but it also achieves very impressive results.

Here's my work on WGAN-GP that generates images of people.WGAN-GP gives amazing result compare to GAN and DCGAN which you can see below.
